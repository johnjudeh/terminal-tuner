"""
This package provides tools to work with audio. This includes reading from the
microphone to create pure-tone sounds and playing them on the speakers.

The encoding format of sound is often in a linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM)
bitstream format. Wave files implement this same format and are a an application
of the Resource Interchange File Format.

PCM is a method of digitally representing analog signals. It works by sampling
the amplitude of a continuous signal at specific time interval and quantizing it
to the nearest digital value available. Linear PCM is a specific method of PCM 
where the quantized values are linearly uniform.
